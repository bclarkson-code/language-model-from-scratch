# Tricycle
Tricycle is a fast, minimal, fully functional deep learning library written from scratch using only python and numpy.

The file `train_smol_gpy.py` trains a 49M parameter, GPT-2 style language model to produce python code in ~2 days on a single RTX 3090.

The entire library, from the automatic differentiation engine to a GPT, is written in ~4500 lines of python + numpy code.

Using [CuPY](https://cupy.dev/), all Tricycle code can run on a GPU and is only about ~TODO: insert comparision to pytorch here.~ % [slower than pytorch](#comparison-with-pytorch). Tricycle is still under active development so this is subject to change.

## Installation
Tricycle uses [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to manage dependencies. While we do support CPU-only computation, optimisation efforts have been focussed on GPU computation so it is pretty slow. If you do have a CUDA capable GPU I would strongly recommend installing the gpu version of Tricycle.

If you have a CUDA capable GPU, you can install Tricycle as follows.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -n tricycle
conda activate tricycle
```

    <summary>CPU and test installation</summary>
If you want to install test dependencies you can do the following.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.test.yml -n tricycle
conda activate tricycle
```

### CPU Installation
If you want to install Tricycle for CPU, you can do the following.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.cpu.yml -n tricycle
conda activate tricycle
```

If you want to install test dependencies on CPU you can do the following.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.cpu.test.yml -n tricycle
conda activate tricycle
```

## Training a GPT on shakespeare
The following toy script will train a small GPT to generate convincing shakespeare.
On my RTX 3090, this takes ~30 mins. For a more realistic training script with metric tracking, gradient accumulation, a validation dataset etc, take a look at `train_smol_gpt.py`

```python
import pickle

from tqdm import tqdm

from tricycle.configs import ShakespeareConfig
from tricycle.dataset import CausalLMDataset
from tricycle.loss import CrossEntropy
from tricycle.models import GPT
from tricycle.optimisers import AdamW
from tricycle_datasets.shakespeare import Shakespeare

config = ShakespeareConfig()
model = GPT(config)

tokens = Shakespeare(vocab_size=config.vocab_size)
dataset = (
    CausalLMDataset(
        tokens=tokens,
        vocab_size=config.vocab_size,
        batch_size=config.batch_size,
        context_window=config.context_window,
    )
    .batch()
    .shuffle()
    .to_tensor()
)
loss_fn = CrossEntropy()
optimiser = AdamW(
    learning_rate=config.max_learning_rate,
    weight_decay=config.weight_decay,
    betas=(config.beta1, config.beta2),
)

model.to_gpu()
loading_bar = tqdm(range(config.steps))
for step in loading_bar:
    optimiser.step()
    inputs, outputs = next(dataset)
    inputs = inputs.to_gpu()
    outputs = outputs.to_gpu()

    logits = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_fn(outputs, logits)
    loss.backward()

    loading_bar.set_description(f"loss: {loss:.3f}")
    model.update(optimiser)

# save results
with open("model.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)
```
Once trained, you can generate infinite shakespeare plays as follows:

```bash
python inference.py model.pkl
```

## How it works
Tricycle code centers around objects called `Tensors`. A `Tensor` is a wrapper around a numpy array that adds some extra features:

```python
from tricycle.tensor import to_tensor

tensor = to_tensor([1,2,3])
print(tensor) # Output: Tensor([1. 2. 3.])
```

You can do a lot of things with a tensor

```python
from tricycle.functions import Softmax

a = to_tensor([1,2,3])
b = to_tensor([4,5,6])

# addition
print(a + b) # Output: Tensor([5. 7. 9.], name=badd)

# comparison
print(a < b) # Output: Tensor([ True  True  True])

# more complex functions
print(Softmax()(a)) # Output: Tensor([0.09003057 0.24472848 0.66524094], name=softmax)

```

### Automatic Differentiation
Unlike vanilla numpy, every operation in Tricycle is attached to a derivative.
When you do some operations on your `Tensor`, Tricycle keeps track of what you did and allows you to differentiate the output.

```python
x = to_tensor(2)

y = x ** 2 + 3 * x + 4
print(y) # Output: Tensor(14.0, name=+ 4)

# derivative of y with respect to (wrt) x is
# 2 * x + 3 = 7
y.backward() # differentiate wrt y
print(x.grad) # Output: Tensor(7.0)
```

This works on multidimensional tensors

```python
import numpy as np

shape = (6,5,4,3,2)
a = to_tensor(np.random.random(shape))
b = to_tensor(np.random.random(shape))

c = a * b # elementwise multiply

c.backward() # differentiate wrt c
assert a.grad.close_to(b) # derivative of c wrt a is b
assert b.grad.close_to(a) # derivative of c wrt b is a
```

And even works through complex operations like attention

```python
from tricycle.blocks import MultiHeadSelfAttention

attention = MultiHeadSelfAttention(
    embedding_dim=32,
    n_heads=2,
    context_window=32,
)

# batch_size, n_tokens, embedding_dim
shape = (4,32,32)
input = to_tensor(np.ones(shape), is_vector=True)

output = attention(input)
output.backward() # differentiate wrt output

print(input.grad) # Output: Tensor([[[ 2.5441039  -2.0558214  -1.7923143  ...
assert input.grad.shape == (4,32,32)
```
